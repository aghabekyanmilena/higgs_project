# Binary Classification with Logistic Regression

## Overview
This Python script conducts binary classification using Logistic Regression on particle physics data. The script follows these major steps:
- Loads a CSV file containing the data
- Explores the structure of the dataset
- Preprocesses the data for classification
- Trains a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluates the model's performance using F1 Score and Accuracy metrics

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Download the script and the CSV file ('training.csv') to the same directory.
4. Run the script.
5. Review the output to observe the model's performance metrics.

## Features
- Loads and inspects the structure of a CSV file
- Prepares data for binary classification
- Uses Logistic Regression for modeling
- Assesses model performance with F1 Score and Accuracy metrics

## Required Libraries
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn
